                                    <p>Over half of UK businesses have used a broker for their energy supply. There is a very realistic chance your business has used an energy broker who has failed to disclose the commission they are receiving from the energy
                                        supplier, if this is the case you are completely entitled to make a claim against the energy company to get the commission paid back to you. </p>
                                    <p>The business energy claim is made against your energy supplier rather than the broker.</p>
